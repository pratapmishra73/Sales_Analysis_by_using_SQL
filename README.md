# SQL Project: Pizza Sales Analysis  

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze real-world business data.  
I worked on a **Pizza Sales Dataset** and solved **13 SQL queries** to extract insights related to revenue, best-selling pizzas, customer behavior, and sales trends.  

The project helped me strengthen my SQL skills such as **Joins, Aggregations, Subqueries, and Grouping** while building a strong foundation in data analysis.

## Dataset Description  

The dataset consists of four key tables:  

- **Pizzas** → (pizza_id, pizza_type_id, size, price)  
- **Pizza_Types** → (pizza_type_id, name, category, ingredients)  
- **Orders** → (order_id, order_date, order_time)  
- **Order_Details** → (order_details_id, order_id, pizza_id, quantity)

- `JOIN` operations  
- `GROUP BY` and Aggregate Functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`)  
- Subqueries  
- Sorting with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`  
- Aliasing
